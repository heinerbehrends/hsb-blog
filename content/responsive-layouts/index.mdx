The CSS grid spec allows us to create responsive layouts without media queries by
specifying the minimum width of a grid item. When the minumum width is reached one
column will automagically be removed. This can be used to show a three column layout
on desktop, a two column layout on tablets and a single column on mobile screens.
The syntax requires us to understand the concepts of the _repeat_ function, the
fraction unit _fr_, and the _minmax_ function. Here's what it looks like when
everything is working together correctly (resize the window to see how the the
layout shifts when the boxes become narrower than 100px):

<InteractiveGrid
  nrOfItems={6}
  gridStyle={{ gridTemplateColumns: `repeat(auto-fill, minmax(100px, 1fr))` }}
/>

## The repeat function

So how does this magic work? Let's deepen our understanding by taking a closer
look at the repeat function. It can be used to specify the number of columns
in a grid _and_ their width. The following interactive example introduces the
repeat function with a fixed number of columns and a fixed column width:

<br />
<FixedSizeColumns />

## The fr unit

If we want to divide the available space evenly among the columns we can use the
fraction unit fr instead of a fixed pixel value.

<br />
<Responsive1FrColumns />

## The minmax function

The minmax function defines a _range_ of preferred values between a _minimum_ and
a _maximum_ value.
When the maximum value is 1fr the available space will be distributed evenly
between the columns and we can use the miminum value to define the point at
which the layout should change.

<br />
<ResponsiveGridGenerator />

## Auto-fill and auto-fit

To make the column grid responsive we need a more ambigious way to specify the number
of columns. There are two options _auto-fill_ and _auto-fit_.
They only differ when there are not enough grid items to fill all the columns of the
first row.

<br />
<ResponsiveAutoFillFit />

## Responsive gap

More often that not it makes sense to make the gaps between the grid items responsive,
too. To achieve this we can use the technique I described in my blog post about
[fluid typography.](/fluid-typography) By defining the size of the gap in the
vw (viewport width) unit the gap will grow with the screen size and by using the
min function we can define a maximum value, so that the gap stops getting bigger
once the maximum width of the layout is reached. All we need to know for this
approach is the gap size at the maximum width of the layout.
