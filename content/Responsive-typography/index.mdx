import VwFontSize from "../../src/components/vwFontSizeGenerator.tsx"
import MinFnFontSize from "../../src/components/MinFnGenerator.tsx"
import ClampFnFontSize from "../../src/components/ClampFnGenerator.tsx"
import InteractiveGrid from "../../src/components/interactiveGrid.tsx"

The CSS math functions min(), max(), minmax() and clamp() can be used for responsive typography and
responsive grid layouts. These functions can be a bit confusing though. Who would have
thought that to declare a maximum value you use the min() function?
With this article I want to it easier to grasp the concept and present a code generator
that demonstrates their usage. Let's start off with responsive typography.

## Fluid Typography

To make the text size scale with the width of the viewport we can use the vw unit. One vw
(viewport width) is defined as one hundreds of the viewport width. If we want to calculate
the right font size in vw units we need to know the preferred font size at a specified
viewport width. For example, if we want a font size of 24 pixels at a 1200 pixel wide screen that would
translate to 2vw (24 / (1200 / 100) = 2). Use the code generator below to get the right vw
value for any given viewport width and font size.

<VwFontSize />
<br />
The second use case that we'll look at is a heading that grows taller as the viewport
gets wider and stops growing as the maximum width of the layout is reached. An example
for this behaviour is the text on the header of the home page of this blog. What
we need to define here is the maximum width of the layout and the desired font size
at the maximum width. The CSS min() function allows us to define the responsive preferred
value and a maximum value.

<br />
<MinFnFontSize />

<br />
The next example adds a minimum value to the equation. The clamp() function takes
a minimum value, a responsive preferred value and a maximum value: clamp(min, preferred,
max).
