This is a post showing MDX in action. This starter now comes with MDX out-of-the-box!

```js
// you can write JSX in your Markdown!
<button>test</button>
```

<button>test</button>

## CodeBlock

```jsx
import React, { useState } from "react"

function Example() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)
  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Click me</button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

## MDX

MDX lets you write JSX embedded inside markdown, perfect for technical blogs. MDX works with Gatsby through [gatsby-plugin-mdx](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-plugin-mdx/). You can learn more about it in the Gatsby docs: [Getting Started with MDX](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/mdx/getting-started/).
