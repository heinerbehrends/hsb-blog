import VwFontSize from "./vwFontSizeGenerator.tsx"
import MinFnFontSize from "./MinFnGenerator.tsx"
import ClampFnFontSize from "./ClampFnGenerator.tsx"

The CSS math functions min(), max() and clamp() can be used for responsive font sizes.
In this blog post I want to reveal to you the logic behind fluid typography and offer
an interactive code generator, so you can easily experiment with the settings.

Specifying the font size in vw units allows us to scale make the font size resond to
the width of the viewport.
vw (viewport width) is defined as 1/100 of the viewport width. To calculate
the correct font size in vw units we need to know the preferred font size at a specific
viewport width. For example, if we want a font size of 24 pixels at a 1200 pixel wide
screen that would translate to 2vw (24 / (1200 / 100) = 2). Use the code generator
below to get the right vw value for any given viewport width and font size.

<br />
<VwFontSize />
<br />
The second use case that we'll look at is a heading that grows taller as the viewport
gets wider and stops growing as the maximum width of the layout is reached. An example
for this behaviour is the text on the header of the home page of this blog. What
we need to define here is the maximum width of the layout and the desired font size
at the maximum width. The CSS min() function allows us to define the responsive preferred
value and a maximum value.

<br />
<br />
<MinFnFontSize />

<br />
The next example adds a minimum value to the equation. The clamp() function takes
a minimum value, a responsive preferred value and a maximum value: clamp(min, preferred,
max).

<ClampFnFontSize />
