On the marketing page of my web development agency I use a video loop of a running
greyhound dog as a hero image. In this article I described how I used React hooks
to animate this loop, so the dog runs away when the user scrolls down.

## The objectives

- When the user scolls down the element should move to the right.
- It should start moving slowly and accelerate.
- Its position should be reset when the user scrolls up.
- This one-off animation on the landing page should use as little code as possible, so
  instead of using a scroll hook from a library we'll roll our own.

## The event listener and useEffect

Let's start off with the basics: adding an event listener for the scroll event and
logging the scroll value to the console. We use a useEffect hook to add the event
listener after the DOM has loaded. We want the effect to run only once when the
component is mounted, so weadd an empty dependency array.
The effect returns a function that removes the event listener to prevent a memory leak.

## The window object and server-side rendering

To prevent a 'window is not defined' error while server-side rendering, the getScrollPosition
function returns zero if window is undefined.

<CodeBlock className={"language-typescript"}>
  {`function getScrollPosition() {
  if (typeof window === "undefined") return 0;
  return window.scrollY;
}
${" "}
useEffect(() => {
  function logScroll() {
    console.log(getScrollPosition());
  }
  window.addEventListener('scroll', logScroll);
  return () => {
    window.removeEventListener('scroll', logScroll);
  };
}, []); // empty array means the effect will run only once`}
</CodeBlock>

## Using transform: translateX to move the element

Now let's use the scroll position to move the element. First we need a ref to the element,
so that we can manipulate it's position. Then we change its position using the style.transform
property.

<CodeBlock className={"language-typescript"}>
  {`const element = useRef(null);
${" "}
useEffect(() => {
  function moveElement() {
    element.current.style.transform = \`translateX(\${getScrollPosition()}px)\`
  }
  window.addEventListener('scroll', moveElement);
  return () => {
    window.removeEventListener('scroll', moveElement);
  };
}, [])
return (
  <div ref={element} />
)`}
</CodeBlock>

## requestAnimationFrame to the rescue

Next we'll use the [requestAnimationFrame](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window/requestAnimationFrame)
function to tell the browser what we're up to.
This will make sure that the animation functions gets called before the next repaint.

<CodeBlock className={"language-typescript"}>
  {`function handleScroll() {
  requestAnimationFrame(moveElement)
}
window.addEventListener('scroll', handleScroll);
return () => {
  window.removeEventListener('scroll', handleScroll);
};`}
</CodeBlock>

## A home grown ease-in function

The next step is to change the movement of the element so that it starts to move slowly
and accelerate as the user is scrolling down. To achieve this we'll use an
[exponential function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_function).

<CodeBlock className={"language-typescript"}>
  {`function easeIn({ value, divisor, exponent }) {
  return Math.pow(value / divisor, exponent)
}`}
</CodeBlock>

## Capturing the scroll direction

The last step to achieve the objectives is to reset the position of the element
when the user scrolls up, so that is never moves backwards. We'll use a ref that holds
the last scroll position and one that holds the current scroll direction.
In a function we compare the last position to the current position and set the scroll direction
accordingly. As a last step we update the last position ref to the current position.

<CodeBlock className={"language-typescript"}>
  {`const lastPosition = useRef(getScrollPosition());
const isScrollingUp = useRef(false);
${" "}
function handleScrollDirection() {
  const scrollPosition = getScrollPosition();
  if (scrollPosition < lastPosition.current) {
    isScrollingUp.current = true;
  } else {
    isScrollingUp.current = false;
  }
  lastPosition.current = scrollPosition;
}`}

</CodeBlock>
Now we can use the scroll direction to reset the position of the element when the user scrolls up.
<CodeBlock className={'language-typescript'}>
  {`const offset = isScrollingUp.current
  ? 0
  : easeIn({
      value: getScrollPosition(),
      divisor: 50,
      exponent: 4,
    });`}
</CodeBlock>

## Putting it all together

To see how all the pieces work together here's a interactive stack blitz editor that shows
how all the code is working together.
Click on the preview button to see the scroll animation in action. You can make changes to
the code and immediately see the results in the preview.

<StackBlitz projectId="react-ts-e4qefd" view="editor" height={500} />
