Giphy concentration is an online version of the children's game concentration,
also known as Memory in Europe. It uses a search box and the Giphy API to fetch
animated gifs. Build with TypeScript and Nextjs it uses serverless functions and
Netlify environment variables to hide the Giphy API Key. <br />
My seven year old daughter loves it.
