Giphy concentration is an online version of the children's game concentration,
also known as Memory in Europe. It uses a search box and the [Giphy API](https://developers.giphy.com/docs/api)
to fetch animated gifs based on a search term. Built with TypeScript and Nextjs it
uses serverless functions to hide the Giphy API Key. Remix routes
make it possible to revisit or share a page with a specific search term. <br />
My seven year old daughter and her friends love it.
