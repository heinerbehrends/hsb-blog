Design and implementation of a website for my New Wave band The Buzz. Featuring
a parallax videowall background that adapts its height to the screen size and a
custom built audio player. <br />
Songs can be liked and the likes are persisted in and retrieved from a [Hasura](https://hasura.io/)
postgreSQL cloud database using serverless functions.
