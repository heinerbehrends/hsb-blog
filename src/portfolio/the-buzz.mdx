Design and implementation of a website for my New Wave band The Buzz. Featuring
a videowall that adapts its height to the screen size, a custom hook parallax
effect using requestAnimationFrame and a special audio player. Uses a Hasura
database and Netlify functions to save the heart count of each song. Build with
Gatsby and TypeScript.
