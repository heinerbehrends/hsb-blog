An implementation of the
[problem set 12 of the MIT course 6.00 ](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-00-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-fall-2008/assignments/pset12.pdf)
_Introduction to computer science and programming_ using the Nextjs framework.
Virus Sim is built using TypeScript and relies on functional programming priciples
like closures for information hiding, pure functions and immutable data structures.
This approach leads to a more maintainable code base and less mental overload
compared to an object oriented approach that uses shared mutable state. <br />
I made use of the [ramda](https://ramdajs.com/) library for its _map_ and _mapAccum_
functions, [recharts](https://recharts.org/) for data visualisation and
react-query to manage server state. <br />
All the heavy computations are done on the server via Nextjs serverless functions.
