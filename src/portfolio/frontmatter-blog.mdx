My developer blog is built using Gatsby, TypeScript and Mdx. [Mdx](https://mdxjs.org)
makes it possible to use React component in a markdown file and create interactive
experiences combined with the ease of markdown. <br />
The styling solution is the zero runtime css-in-typescript
library [vanilla extract](https://vanilla-extract.style/) with the the _sprinkles_
extension for atomic css.
