An implementation of Conwell's Game of Life for the react library. It features
the possibility to seed many different patterns like methusalems, oscillators and
space ships, controls for the speed and a start/stop button.
Game of Life is build using Redux for state management and the [immer library](immerjs.github.io/)
for immutable data structures. The size of the game automatically adapts to the
size of the screen.
