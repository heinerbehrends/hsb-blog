An implementation of [Conways's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)
for the react library. It features the possibility to seed many different patterns  
like methusalems, oscillators and space ships, a control for the speed and a
start/stop button. <br />
Game of Life is built using Redux for state management and the [immer library](immerjs.github.io/)
for immutable data structures. The size of the game automatically adapts to the
size of the screen.
