Pizzazz is to scrabble what a blog post is to a tweet. Pizzazz consists of a
React frontend that uses Redux and Redux-Saga for async state management and a
Nodejs backend. Web sockets are used for fast bi-directional communication between
the server and the client.
Because it is all client side rendered, Pizzazz is not yet up to my standards for
fast websites, unfortunately it takes a long time to load.

Be patient and check it out at https://pizzazz-micro-scrabble.herokuapp.com/ <br />
